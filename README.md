# 🔐 LockMe: Secure File Encryption and Decryption Desktop Application

**LockMe** is a modern, cross-platform desktop application built to make file encryption and decryption secure, fast, and user-friendly. Designed for Windows and Linux users, LockMe empowers individuals and small businesses to protect sensitive data using industry-standard cryptographic techniques such as AES-256 — all with a minimal, intuitive interface.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **AES-256 encryption** for high-grade file security
- 🧑‍💻 **Cross-platform compatibility**: works on Windows and Linux
- 🖱️ **Drag-and-drop interface** for easy file handling
- 📁 **Support for multiple file types**: documents, images, archives
- 🔑 **Local key generation and storage** (no cloud required)
- 🔎 **File integrity verification**
- 💬 **Real-time progress indicators and feedback**
- 🚫 **Offline functionality**: no internet or cloud services needed

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. **Provide a cross-platform desktop solution** for file encryption and decryption.
2. **Implement strong cryptographic algorithms**, primarily AES-256.
3. **Design a beginner-friendly interface** with drag-and-drop and status messages.
4. **Ensure secure key management** (generate, store, retrieve locally).
5. **Keep the tool lightweight and privacy-focused** without relying on cloud services.

## 🧠 Built With

- **Programming Language**: Java / Python / C++ (based on final implementation)
- **Crypto Libraries**: 
  - PyCryptodome (Python)
  - Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)
  - Crypto++ (C++)
- **Frameworks**:
  - Qt or Electron for GUI
  - Tkinter or PyQt (Python option)
- **Encryption Algorithms**:
  - AES-256 (primary)
  - RSA (for future secure key exchange support)

## 🧪 Security & Evaluation

LockMe was evaluated using these metrics:
- ⏱️ **Encryption speed & throughput**
- 🧠 **Memory and CPU usage**
- 🔒 **Resistance to brute-force and side-channel attacks**
- 🧪 **User acceptance & feedback testing**

## 🔍 Limitations

- 🚫 No batch encryption (currently single-file only)
- ☁️ No cloud sync or integration with services like Google Drive
- 🔐 Advanced key sharing not implemented (basic key handling only)

## 🧩 Target Users

- Students and non-technical users who want simple encryption
- Freelancers and small businesses with security-conscious workflows
- IT professionals needing offline, GUI-based encryption tools
